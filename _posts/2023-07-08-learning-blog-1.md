# Introduction
The purpose of this blog is to keep up with things in technology, software engineering and some times other things. One effective way to strengthen your understanding about something is to try and explain the thing to others. That's what I will be trying out in these blogs.

### GPT-4 API General Availability
As of July 6, 2023, openai announced that all paid API users will have access to GPT-4. GPT-3.5 Turbo, DALLÂ·E and Whisper APIs are also generally available now. For newer customers it will be available by end of this month. There is also deprecation planned for older models. 
This should enable developers to have a more powerful LLM engine backing their applications. Details [here](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-4-api-general-availability) (openai.com)
